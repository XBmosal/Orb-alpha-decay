<#
  Publishes Flow Terminal as a Windows x64 application (multi-file folder).
  Run on Windows with the .NET 8 SDK installed:
      pwsh build/publish.ps1                 # framework-dependent (needs .NET 8 Desktop Runtime)
      pwsh build/publish.ps1 -SelfContained  # self-contained (no runtime needed; larger)
  Output: artifacts/publish/  (zip the WHOLE folder to distribute)

  NOTE: WPF must NOT be published as a single file — single-file bundling breaks
  WPF's font cache (TypeInitializationException in MS.Internal.FontCache.MajorLanguages).
  This script intentionally produces a multi-file folder.
