# Feature Status

Status legend: **Not started** · **Interface only** · **Mock** · **Partial** ·
**Complete** · **Blocked (SDK)** · **Blocked (entitlement)** · **Experimental** ·
**Estimated** · **Tested** · **Benchmarked**.

A feature is only marked **Complete** when its source exists, is wired into the
app, the solution compiles, tests exist and pass, and limitations are documented.
A button/view/interface/mock value alone never counts as complete.

> Current milestone: **Phases 0–7 + 9 delivered; Phase 8 blocked by the Rithmic
> SDK.** The cross-platform core (23 projects) builds on Linux/CI; the WPF shell
> builds on Windows. 161 tests pass, including headless SkiaSharp pixel tests of
> the mandated candle colors, the liquidity heatmap, all eight order-flow
> detectors, the review system, and end-to-end record → DuckDB inspect →
> deterministic replay.

## Phase 10 — Remaining
| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 10 Packaging & stabilization | Not started |

## Known limitations (current)
- The WPF shell and `UiTests` requiring WPF build/run on **Windows only**; the
  Linux CI job covers the cross-platform core and all non-WPF tests.
- Live Rithmic data is unavailable until the authorized SDK is installed and wired
  (Phase 8). All Rithmic providers fail loudly rather than fabricate data.
- Charts, DOM, footprints, heatmap, and detectors are **not yet implemented**;
  the shell shows labelled placeholders for those regions.
